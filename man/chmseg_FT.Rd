\title{#TOFIX @titel Fast and straightforward watershed segmentation based on 'ForestTools'}
\usage{
chmseg_FT(treepos = NULL, chm = NULL, minTreeAlt = 2,
  format = "polygons", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{treepos}{\code{SpatialPointsDataFrame}. The point locations of treetops. The function will generally produce a
number of crown segments equal to the number of treetops.}

\item{chm}{raster*. Canopy height model in \code{raster} format. Should be the same that was used to create
the input for \code{treepos}.}

\item{minTreeAlt}{numeric. The minimum height value for a \code{CHM} pixel to be considered as part of a crown segment.
All \code{chm} pixels beneath this value will be masked out. Note that this value should be lower than the minimum
height of \code{treepos}.}

\item{format}{character. Format of the function's output. Can be set to either 'raster' or 'polygons'.}

\item{verbose}{to be quiet FALSE}
}
\description{
'ForestTools' segmentation of individual tree crowns based on a canopy height model and initial seeding points (trees). Very fast algorithm based on the imagr watershed algorithm.
