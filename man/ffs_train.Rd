\description{
ffs_train is a wrapper function for a simple use of the forwatrd feature sselection approach
of training random forest classification models. This validation is particulary suitable for
leave-location-out cross validations where variable selection
MUST be based on the performance of the model on the hold out station.
See \href{https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815217310976}{Meyer et al. (2018)}
for further details.
This is in fact the case while using time space variable vegetation patterns for classification purposes.
For the uav based RGB/NIR imagery it provides an optimized preconfiguration for the classification goals.
